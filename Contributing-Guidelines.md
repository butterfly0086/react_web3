# Contributing Guidelines

I welcome any and all questions/suggestions/PRs/etc.! If you're interested in helping out, here's a (brief) guide to get you started:

- The project is written in Typescript, all files are in the [`src`](./src/) directory.

- To build/watch changes in these files, run `npm run build`/`npm run watch`.

- Testing is done with Jest, run with `npm run test`
